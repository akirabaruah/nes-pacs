# nes-pacs

This project attempts to emulate the hardware of the Nintendo
Entertainment System (NES) on an Altera Cyclone V FPGA.


## Background

The NES uses an 8-bit processor, with a 16-bit address space, based on
the MOS Technology 6502.


## Objectives

Write working implementations of the following NES components in
SystemVerilog:

- Ricoh 2A03 processor (including audio processing unit)
- NES Picture Processing Unit (PPU)


## Project Team

This project is conducted as part of Stephen Edwards's [Embedded
Systems](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2016/4840-spring/index.html)
(CSEE 4840) course at Columbia University.
